# Otmane's Portfolio

Portfolio website built in React.  
This was a website built to showcase my technical skills, web design skills.

### Why:

Building my website is an excellent way to demonstrate my skills and abilities to potential employers or clients. By showcasing some of my previous work, a web developer can provide evidence of their expertise and experience in creating websites and applications.
